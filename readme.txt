Overrides The Events Calendar's Day View with a Schedule Day View, displaying events within All Day, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening contexts, as well as indicating events happening right now.

== Description ==

Activating this extension will replace The Events Calendar's Day View with a Schedule Day View. This is accomplished by doing a template override through a plugin instead of within your active theme.

Schedule Day View displays a single day's events with the added context of All Day, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening; it also highlights events happening _right now._

== Installation ==

Install and activate like any other plugin!

* You can upload the plugin zip file via the *Plugins ‣ Add New* screen
* You can unzip the plugin and then upload to your plugin directory (typically _wp-content/plugins)_ via FTP
* Once it has been installed or uploaded, simply visit the main plugin list and activate it
